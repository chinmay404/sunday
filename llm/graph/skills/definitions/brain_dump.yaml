name: brain_dump
description: "Process a messy brain dump into organized threads, goals, and actions. Turn chaos into structure."
trigger_hint: "brain dump, dump everything, let me think out loud, just need to get this out, unload"

steps:
  - "Let Chinmay dump everything — don't interrupt until he signals he's done or pauses"
  - "Categorize what came out: actionable items, worries, ideas, decisions needed, pure venting"
  - "For actionable items: use create_thread for follow-ups or create_goal for bigger objectives with goal_add_step for concrete steps"
  - "For worries: use create_thread with type 'worry' to track them — acknowledging them helps"
  - "For ideas: use create_thread with type 'idea' to capture before they vanish"
  - "For decisions: identify what information is missing and suggest concrete next steps to decide"
  - "For venting: just acknowledge it — not everything needs to be actionable"
  - "Summarize what was captured and highlight what needs attention first"

tools_hint:
  - create_thread
  - create_goal
  - goal_add_step
  - save_preference
  - search_memory

output_format: "After the dump, give a clean summary: 'Here's what I captured: X threads, Y goals. Top priority is Z.' Grounding, not overwhelming."
notes: "The value is in the processing, not just the listening. Turn chaos into structure without being annoying about it. Sometimes the act of organizing is the therapy."
