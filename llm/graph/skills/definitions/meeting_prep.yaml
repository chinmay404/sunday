name: meeting_prep
description: "Prepare for an upcoming meeting — gather context, talking points, and open items related to attendees or topic."
trigger_hint: "meeting prep, prepare for meeting, what should I bring up, get ready for call"

steps:
  - "Ask which meeting or infer from calendar context"
  - "Use search_memory for any previous conversations about this person/topic/project"
  - "Use get_person_info if meeting is with a known person — check relationship, last interactions"
  - "Use list_threads to find any open threads related to this meeting's topic or attendees"
  - "Use list_goals to check if any active goals are relevant to the meeting"
  - "Compile: key context, talking points, open questions, things to follow up on"
  - "After the meeting, suggest creating threads for any new action items using create_thread"

tools_hint:
  - search_memory
  - get_person_info
  - list_threads
  - list_goals

output_format: "Quick bullet list. Context first, then talking points, then questions to ask. No fluff."
notes: "Be practical. Don't generate generic talking points — use what you actually know from memory. If you don't know much about the person/topic, say so."
